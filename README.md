An automatic rat-a-tat-cat tournament engine

This is a framework to let you write several "rat-a-tat-cat" players in python logic, and pit them against each other for thousands of hands to see who wins.   

# Quick Game summary
Rat-a-tat-cat is a simple card game like "Golf."

It's liker poker for 8 year olds - every player has 2 showing cards, and 2 hole cards. Not even you can see your own hole cards. Players take turns drawing cards. When you've drawn a card, you may replace any one of their cards (even if they can't see its value) with the card you drew (or not, and just discard it). Play ends when any player decides to end it; the winner has the lowest sum of cards.
